## Tweet 1 (Hook)

Managing 10+ Git repos is painful.

Status across all? Shell scripts.
Branch on all? More scripts.
Sync all? You get the idea.

## Tweet 2 (Solution)

Introducing Mars — a polyrepo workspace manager.

One CLI for:
→ init/clone/status across all repos
→ Tag-based filtering (--tag frontend)
→ Parallel operations (4 concurrent jobs)
→ Cross-repo branching & sync

Pure bash 3.2+, zero dependencies.

## Tweet 3 (Differentiator)

The killer feature: shared Claude configuration.

Your `claude.md` and `.claude/` directory work across all repos in the workspace.

Multi-repo Claude Code workflows, finally.
